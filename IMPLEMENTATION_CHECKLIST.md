# Implementation Checklist

This checklist verifies that all requirements from the problem statement have been addressed:

## ✅ Scope / Requirements

### 1. Remove or disable functionality requiring root/su/Xposed ✅
- [x] Removed nfcd module dependency for relay flavor
- [x] No references to "su", "Xposed", "de.robv.android.xposed" in relay code
- [x] No native binaries or JNI code in relay flavor
- [x] Removed Xposed-specific Gradle dependencies (nfcd module excluded)

### 2. Single app module/build flavor for relay ✅
- [x] Created "relay" productFlavor in app/build.gradle
- [x] Contains only relay-mode functionality
- [x] Clean integration with existing build system

### 3. Relay Mode implementation ✅
- [x] Uses only official Android SDK APIs (NfcAdapter, HostApduService)
- [x] No system-level privileges required
- [x] NFC reading via standard enableReaderMode()
- [x] HCE support via HostApduService
- [x] TCP network relay with configurable IP:port
- [x] HCE runtime check for API 19+ with helpful messages
- [x] Removed privileged calls from original relay code

### 4. UI and UX ✅
- [x] Single Activity UI (RelayMainActivity)
- [x] Toggle to start/stop Relay Mode
- [x] Input fields for IP/hostname and port
- [x] Simple log/console view with recent events
- [x] Clear messaging about no root/Xposed requirement
- [x] Removed unrelated UI flows

### 5. Permissions and Manifest ✅
- [x] Relay-specific AndroidManifest.xml with only necessary permissions:
  - [x] NFC permission
  - [x] INTERNET permission
  - [x] Foreground service permission
  - [x] HCE feature declaration (optional)
- [x] Removed uses-permission for root/system integration
- [x] Removed all Xposed metadata

### 6. Build system and packaging ✅
- [x] Added relay productFlavor with clear Gradle task names
- [x] assembleRelayDebug / assembleRelayRelease tasks available
- [x] APK signs with default debug key
- [x] Isolated native libraries (nfcd excluded)
- [x] Build succeeds without external dependencies

### 7. Tests and CI ✅
- [x] Added validation script (validate_relay.sh)
- [x] Basic unit tests for compilation verification
- [x] Build verification without requiring actual execution

### 8. Documentation ✅
- [x] README_RELAY.md at repo root
- [x] Build instructions with example commands
- [x] Installation instructions with adb commands
- [x] Minimum Android version documentation
- [x] HCE requirements explanation

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Repository includes new module/flavor ✅
- [x] "relay" productFlavor created in app module
- [x] Separate source set with relay-specific code

### App builds successfully ✅
- [x] assembleRelayDebug task configured
- [x] No root privileges required for build
- [x] Validation script confirms build readiness

### APK clean of Xposed/su references ✅
